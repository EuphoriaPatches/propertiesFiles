#### Template for Modded Blocks:
```properties
# Description of the block ID
block.XXXXX = vanillaId1 vanillaId2 vanillaId3 ... \

...
lastModInThisIDName:modId1 lastModInThisIDName:modId2 lastModInThisIDName:modId3

# Description of the Next block ID
block.YYYYY = ...
```

**Important Notes:**
- Group IDs by mods (each mod on its own line)

</details>

## Version Information

- Each properties file has its own version number
- Version increases ONLY when vanilla components change
- Adding mod entries doesn't change the version number
- These files are always up-to-date with Euphoria Patches dev versions

## Helpful Tools

These tools make contributing easier:

- **[Euphoria Companion](https://modrinth.com/mod/euphoria-companion)**: Get a complete list of all blocks in your current game and which ones are missing in the properties files and much more!
- **[ItemStackExporter](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemstackexporter)**: Export many blocks at once from JEI/REI or inventory

## Advanced Tips

- **Debug Worlds**: If Euphoria Companion isn't available for your version, hold Alt while selecting world type in world creation menu to create a debug world containing every block the game knows about

- **Color Coded Programs**:
  1. Go to "Other" tab in the Shader Settings and enable "Color Coded Programs"
  2. This reveals how blocks are rendered by coloring them based on their render program:
     - Green: Solid blocks (gbuffers_terrain)
     - Dark Blue: Translucent blocks (gbuffers_water)
     - Yellow: Block entities (gbuffers_block)
     - Red: Entities (gbuffers_entities)
     - Other colors: Various other programs

- **Finding Missing Block Properties**:
  1. Enable Color Coded Programs
  2. Hold a spider eye in one hand
  3. Blocks with missing properties will appear as magenta/black striped pattern
  4. Hold spider eyes in both hands to disable the color coding

- **Block States**: Not all blockstates need to be added separately
  - For many blocks (like facing directions), you only need the base ID
  - Some blocks only need specific states differentiated (like `powered=true` vs `powered=false`)

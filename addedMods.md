- In Testing: This mod either needs to be re-reviewed, or simply is still in the process of being added.

- Autogenerated Content: This mod contains content that is auto-generated and the blocks that exist will change per modlist. Typically we'll try and support as many of said blocks as possible or use tags where applicable (Iris exclusive feature), however it is most likely you'll need to add blocks yourself. If you're going to use this tag, please explain what is being autogenerated and why in a comment.
- Unknown: Unable to make a determination of how well a mod has been added due to various factors. Please leave a comment if you're gonna use this status!
